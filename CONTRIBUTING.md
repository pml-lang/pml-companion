# Overview

We use GitHub to:

- host source code
- track issues
- discuss ideas, new features, etc.
- answer questions
- manage pull requests (PRs)

Everybody is welcome to participate in a friendly, collaborative environment.

Your input counts and is very much appreciated!


# Contributing

## How to Report a Bug

To report a bug open a new [issue] and use template 'Bug report'.

## How to Submit an Enhancement?

If you want to discuss the enhancement first (an idea, new feature, or any other enhancement), open a new [discussion] and select an appropriate category.

Otherwise open a new [issue] and use template 'Enhancement'.

## How to Ask a Question?

Open a new [discussion] and select category 'Q&A' (questions and answers).

## Git Branches

The following Git branches are used:

- `main`

    This branch contains the source code of the latest public, stable release.

    `main` is the default branch.

    Tags are used for releases.

- `develop`

    This branch contains the source code of the next release that will be published in the future (i.e. the upcoming release under construction).

There might be other branches dedicated to new features, bug fixes, etc.

## Pull Requests

No pull request (PR) should be made to branch `main`, unless the PR is pre-discussed and agreed upon.

Pull requests can be submitted to branch `develop`.

## How to Submit a PR

For detailed instructions please search the net for 'submit pr to github' or read [How to create a pull request in GitHub](https://opensource.com/article/19/7/create-pull-request-github).

If you just want to edit a single file, you can display the file in GitHub, use the online editor to make changes, and then commit your changes.
